# Seam-Carving
The Seam carving Project for Data and Algorithms class summer 2022
Seam-carving is a content-aware image resizing technique where the image is reduced in size by one pixel of height (or width) at a time. This algorithm is beneficial since it preserves things such as aspect ratio and objects present. It does this by removing the "least important" of each image.
